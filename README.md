# Name: Xuwen Dong(Jessica)

# Project title: Circles

# Codes:
I used sin(), map(),for loop, rotate, createColorPicker(), noise(),createSlider(), mouseX/Y, and a little CSS on the layout.
I received some helps on "how to center the canvas", problem with github repository and rotate function.

# Instructions:
The project provides the viewer several ways to modify the existing pattern. Simply move the mouse on the page to change 
the pattern's shape. Use the slider below to change the stroke weight. Use the color picker to change colors.
